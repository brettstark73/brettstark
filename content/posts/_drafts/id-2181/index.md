[Carefree](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/carefree) - free of care; having no worries or troubles.

I'm trying to think of when I was last carefree. Let's have a brief think:

- 50's - not yet - too early to tell

- 40's - rarely if ever - same as 30's - increased work pressure in mid to late 40's

- 30's - rarely if ever - constant worry and stresses with work, money, kids, and general life

- 20's - some glimpses

- 10's - some memories age 10 to 12

- 0's - main memories

So, fundamentally, I'm saying that most of my memories of being carefree were well before I was even 20! Over 35 years ago!! Tragic. Of course, there are almost no responsibilities and stresses at that age. I guess some of my life's general worries and stresses have been typical. Money and finances, work pressure, family, and parenting. Of course, there are [huge stressors](https://www.uhhospitals.org/blog/articles/2015/07/the-top-5-most-stressful-life-events) also, including the death of those closest to you which I am currently experiencing. Generally, as responsibilities grow during adulthood, so do worries and stressors. Likewise, as life continues, chances grow that a top stressor like job loss, death, illness, etc can occur. In a future post, I'll think about how to manage stress but for now, let's think about carefree.

Some of my memories and thoughts when carefree -

- Spending lots of time outside

- Simple activities, bike riding, beach, tree climbing

- Pre-internet / limited technology / TV

- Mind focused on that day/activity, not future or past

As we get further into adulthood, simple lessons here could be to get outside more and do basic activities that are just fun. A real challenge that I find difficult is simply understanding what is fun! Life can be so challenging with the amount of work and other responsibilities we have that we forget what is fun. In some senses, I know I have.
