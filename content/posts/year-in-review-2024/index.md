## Review

- Health: Quite good exercise routines with running and a decent of tennis. Can improve eating and drinking, basically food intake.

- Fun: Didn't sail at all, unfortunately. Did though create a hobby of astrophotography with the amazing Seestar S50. Did quite a bit of private travel which was OK. Very little business travel, only one trip.

- $: Spent a lot of money including a kids' car and other things, furniture, travel, etc. Did not meet goals.
