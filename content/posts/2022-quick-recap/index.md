2022 was better than 2020/2021 but also with some difficulties.  
My job was hugely stressful and very difficult.  
Positives though -
\- Pandemic subsiding  
\- Awesome 6 wk trip to Australia  
\- Ran 800km  
\- Read > 20 books  
\- Family vacation up through Michigan and Upper Peninsula Michigan

2023 Focus:  
\- Health - running, eating, drinking  
\- Work balance  
\- Hobbies/Fun
