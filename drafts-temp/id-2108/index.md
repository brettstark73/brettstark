OK, so a quick recap of my earlier life.

- Graduated in 1995 with a Masters in Engineering, IT&T.
  - I generally disliked University. Too much work, not enough fun. I would have chosen the University of Adelaide if I had my time again. I did not do enough research and unfortunately, this gave me significant regrets. University of South Australia at the Levels was at the time, a big fat dump. All guys, zero women, zero cafes, zero pubs, zero restaurants and you guessed it, zero social life. Miles from anywhere. The absolute pits and I have no fond memories of my University time. Adelaide University, on the other hand, was the opposite in every category.
  - Boarded with a very nice family from 1991 to 1994. David and Margaret were super nice, massive Crows fans and Margaret worked at a chocolate shop, so never-ending chocolate! They were very nice to me as I lived there during the week and then went home to Birdwood on the weekends. Except for Yutz the German Shephard. He hated me and would have eaten me in a heartbeat.
  - Lived with a few friends in 1995 for a year or so. Was OK but didn't work out in the end. I was too busy with school and seemingly, no one else was.

- 1st Job at AWA Defence Industries Q4 1995 - The company was bought by British Aerospace.
  - Totally broke, so took the job straight after University. Really regret not having more time to relax and travel before full-time work.
  - The job was quite OK, mostly electronics and interesting with a defence project. Ended up using VHDL to design hardware which was cool and cutting-edge at the time. Once the project neared completion, however, it got boring and I decided I wanted a change.
  - Lived with a few friends in a rental house north of Adelaide. Actually, recall moving twice around this period, changing housemates.
  - A great friend of mine living with us had a major health scare at this time, unfortunately. He's OK now and actually changed careers to become a doctor!

- 2nd Job was I think 1998 or so - Motorola Australia Software Centre (MASC).
  - Overall, I enjoyed my time at MASC. Most of the employees were young, so it was a bit of a party atmosphere, for example with the social club. I did have a super asshole of a boss at this time in automotive electronics, by far the worst boss of my career even so far till the age of 50. Most people were nice and decent though.
  - Quite interesting technology with telecommunications and smart cards. The job I actually got hired for, VHDL did not hold much interest for me. Crazy also that smart cards were being worked on in this time frame but took so long to be in the public market. Ended up in telecommunications which is how I got further into Motorola. That technology around early cell phones and infrastructure was definitely interesting.
  - This time was in my early to latter 20s. I don't remember that much fun really. Definitely mostly just a lot of work. I guess there must have been some fun in there somewhere. No travel to speak of. No big memories stick out that greatly. My 21st was fun at Birdwood Motor Museum. Here I had a mix of people from family, University, and Adelaide Hills Lutheran Church youth groups.
  - Going backward a bit, during my mid-teens, say age 16/17 or so through to my early 20s, I was involved in the Birdwood Youth Group. Although I met lots of nice people and good friends in various youth groups during this period, I have regrets about being involved with religion at this age. In hindsight, it's a bit strange really.

- Business travel to the US in early 2000. Here is where my life branched. At the time I was working on telecommunications equipment at Motorola Australia. I ended up with a short-term assignment in Chicago through to 2002.
  - This was a period of great turbulence moving from small-town Australia to large Chicago. There was also a lot of fun going to Chicago almost every weekend for fancy restaurants, pubs, and live music. Quite unbelievable seeing Chicago after growing up in Palmer, a town of 80 people!
  - I worked in various Motorola divisions in telecommunications, packet data, and also standards work with early technology around data communications including Home Agent. This was the very early days of packet data and the systems invented set the stage for how we could easily use our phones and browse the web today, even if we're mobile, in the car, changing countries via travel, etc.
  - Standards work is the most boring but also the best. The travel involved is unbelievable. During this time I had a business trip to Hawaii which was incredible. Unfortunately at the time, I thought I had a full-time job in the US but it was canceled and so I was out of work and went home to Australia. This happened whilst in Hawaii and while I had left most of my stuff in the US expecting the job.

- Got a full-time, US-based job in 2002 from Motorola Automotive, Deer Park a suburb north of Chicago. This ended up being quite coincidental as a couple of colleagues from Motorola Adelaide were working there and we randomly met at a Powderfinger concert in Chicago! They introduced me to their boss who gave me a job. I was thrown in the deep end a bit and led my first sizeable software team working on connected vehicle technology. Basically a phone in a box! This was the first time I worked with Daimler Chrysler as a customer and some of the people there in Sindelfingen, I still know and count as good friends!

- Married 2003. Some small trips next few years. One trip to Bali for my brother's wedding. This was a time in my 30s and I remember lots of fun. A lot of nights out in Chicago. A lot of Chicago Cubs baseball. Some small trips to areas around Chicago in the Midwest, particularly Saugatuck in Michigan.

- Changed jobs to Motorola handset division in 2005 and worked on mid-tier GSM mobile phones for several years. Funny now in the 2020s looking back at the technology then which was 2G and 3G. Very low data rates with very basic phones back then. Very small screens and I also remember working with the first Motorola phone designed in conjunction with Apple. It had 100 iTunes songs on what I think was a tiny SD card! My first role there was to manage the platform software for the successor to the Razor phone which was basically a refresh.

- I then went back to the automotive area, what would be then, Continental in 2010. Helped get a large vehicle connectivity project back on track and had significant travel during this period. To Germany primarily, and also to Beijing. Many many trips to Sindelfingen where Daimler was. I remember changing from travel clothes into a suit on the top of a Daimler car park before a big escalation meeting. The meeting was in German until I had to present. I really should have learned German for all the times I was there!

- Most importantly, Amelia was born during this period, in 2007. William was born in 2009. During this time, my parents visited us in Chicago three times. A particularly memorable trip was to the Smoky Mountains in Tennessee in a large black Expedition truck, similar to those the secret service drive.

- Took a product management role during years 2015 to 2020 and had significant business travel during this period. Germany, China, France, Japan. I thought I would like Japan but didn't really. Needed to get out into the country probably. I will always remember Shanghai and Regensburg and never forget being in Paris for the World Cup victory and Bastille Day in one weekend! I also went to Las Vegas most years for the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) and was in Singapore a few times. Another great business trip was to see a SpaceX launch. Highlights include:
  - Great Wall of China
  - Paris, France
  - Shanghai, China
  - Stockholm, Sweden
  - Regensburg, Germany
  - Singapore

- Started doing more trips to Australia in this period. Trips in 2008, 2012, 2014, 2016, 2018, 2022, and 2023. Interrupted by COVID. The 2008 and 2012 trips were with the full family. The 2014 trip happened because I was able to combine it with a business trip to Singapore. The trips in 2016, 2018, and onwards were happening more frequently as Mum's health declined. Interrupted though by COVID.
  - 2016 was highlighted by Dad's 70th Birthday
  - 2018, and 2022 were highlighted by a lot of winery day trips!

- COVID 2020 to 2022. Disaster.
  - I truly believe we have not yet recovered from this or even really processed it. We got through it because we had to. Meanwhile, a lot of stress, pain, and even trauma. Many family memories were lost through time.

- 2023 - up to date and would need a full post for the shit year that 2023 is.
