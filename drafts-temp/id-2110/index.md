Trying to write some things about Mum so that I don't lose them.

- Hard worker. Always working either in shops, businesses or at home.

- Good cook!

- Always laughing. Always having fun. Very rarely complaining.

- Loved traveling. Loved seeing something new.

- Loved Australia, Tom Price, the ocean, caravaning.

- Champagne.

- Garlic prawns. Any and all or most seafood.

- Loves warm weather. Dislikes the cold.

- Likes gardening and flowers.

2022 - I spent around 6 weeks in Australia after COVID. I'll never forget the many winery day trips we took. I would literally google for something that looked good and take Mum and Dad on a day trip.
